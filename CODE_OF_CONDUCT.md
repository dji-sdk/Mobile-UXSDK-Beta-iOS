We want a productive, happy community that can welcome new ideas and foster collaboration. This code of conduct exists to ensure that diverse groups collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will challenge prejudice that could jeopardize the participation of any person in this project.

## Our Standards and Responsibilities
* Be considerate and respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
* Be collaborative and ask for help when unsure.
* Gracefully accept constructive criticism.
* Resolve disagreements constructively and value discussion, clarity and consensus. 
* Take responsibility when a mistake is made and work to right the wrong.

A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. We would like to build an environment where the community works together to resolve conflicts. In order to do this, the project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.

This Code is not exhaustive or complete. It is not a rulebook; it serves to distill our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.
