/**
 * The PictureInPicturePanelWidget is a subclass of DUXBetaFreeformPanelWidget which implements a picture in picture panel. (Technically this is a widget
 * in widget panel.) Widgets in the PIP pane can be tapped and swapped with the widget passed in. Usage is fairly simple but has a few complexities
 * that can appear confusing.
 *
 * After setting up the PIP pane, install a tap notification handler to see when a pane has been tapped. The handler has the format:
 * (PaneID) -> void. When it is called, the top visible PaneID which was tapped is passed to the handler.
 *
 * After receiving the PaneID, if swap is desired, call the method swapWidget(PaneID, fromController, widget). This method specifies the
 * Pane to swap out, the controller which owns the widget being moved in to the Pane where the removed pane will reside, and the actual widget to exchange.
 *
 * The widget being put into fromController will be placed back in the view hierarchy at the same location as the widget being replaced. Once placed,
 * autolayout MUST be applied to handle positioning. That is beyond the scope the PIP widget since it knows nothing about proper widget positioning.
